Challenge: Make some items glow to help player understand their purpose
- the way that this is implemented: The bad items glow with a red hue to let users know that they are bad items. 

Note: despite commits not seeming even or equal, all team members worked and contributed equally. Some members mostly worked on art, and some had issues commiting to the Git. What we did to fix this is we sent our code and assets over to other teammates for them to commit and push.
